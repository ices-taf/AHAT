### Assessment plots and statistical analysis

This report provides details of the assessment of mercury concentrations
in arctic char at station Amituk Lake.

Timeseries metadata. Key information about the timeseries.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Assessment plot. The fitted trend (solid line) with pointwise 90%
confidence bands (grey shaded areas). The trend is plotted on the log
scale, with the axis labels back-transformed for ease of interpretation.
The points are the annual medians of the individual log concentration
measurements.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Trend with data. The fitted trend with pointwise 90% confidence bands.
The points are the individual concentration measurements, with d or q
denoting values below the limit of detection or quantification and \<
denoting other less-than values.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Auxiliary data. The individual concentration measurements with
supporting information: mean length of the individuals in the sample;
dry weight (%) of the sample; lipid weight (%) of the sample.

</li>

<li class="gap">

Stable isotope data. The individual concentration measurements with
supporting information: the mean length of the individuals in the
sample; the isotope ratio 13C:12C and the isotope ratio 15N:14N.

Statistical analysis. This tab summarises the fits of models with
different amount of smoothing. The final choice is the model with the
minimum AICc (with the caveat that a linear model is always preferred to
a mean model if there are sufficient years of data). The tab also gives
the contrast between the fitted values at the start and end of the
timeseries, and over the most recent twenty years.

**Interpretation**

There is a significant temporal trend in the time series (p = 0.0041).
The trend is nonlinear (p = 0.0414) so the shape of the trend must be
assessed visually. Concentrations at the end of the time series were
signficantly lower than those at the start of the time series (p =
0.0351) by an estimated 44.3%.

The lowest detectable annual increase in the time series (two-sided
test, power = 80%, size = 5%) is 4%. Had every year been sampled (so
there were no gaps in the time series), the lowest detectable annual
increase would have been 3.8%. The lowest detectable annual increase
with 10 years of annual monitoring is 10.2%. The lowest detectable
annual decrease with 10 years of annual monitoring is 9.3%.

Given the variability in the data, 16 years of annual monitoring would
be required to detect an annual increase of 5% with 80% power (two-sided
test, size = 5%).

The power of the time series to detect an annual increase of 5% is 94%
(two-sided test, size = 5%). Had every year been sampled, the power
would have been 95%. With 10 years of annual monitoring, the power would
be 29%.
